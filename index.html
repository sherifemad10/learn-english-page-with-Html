<h3><i>Transcript</i></h3>
<p><b>Host:</b> At exam time it is important to sleep well. Today we have Doctor Baker with us in the studio and he is <br>going to give us five top tips for getting a good night’s sleep. Welcome to the show, Doctor Baker. <br>
<br>
   <b> Dr Baker:</b> Thank you. It’s great to be here. Let’s start with tip one. Don’t go to bed with the television on.<br> Some people think they can sleep well with the TV on, but the noise and lights mean you don’t really sleep<br> well, so turn it off!<br>
    <br>
   Tip two:  Don’t think too much before bedtime. Do your hardest homework earlier in the evening.<br> Do easier homework later. If your brain is too busy and full of ideas it takes longer to get to sleep.<br>
    <br>
    Tip three: Don’t play video games for an hour before you go to sleep. They also make your brain too busy<br> and active. <br>
    <br>
    Tip four: Turn off your cell phone when you go to bed. What is so important that it can’t wait until the<br> morning? If possible, leave your phone in another room.<br> 
    <br>
    Tip five: Play music if you like. But don’t play it too loud. Turn the sound down low.<br>
    <br>
   <b>Host:</b>  Thank you, Doctor. That is very useful advice for our young listeners.</p>

   <h3><i><u> GETTING READY FOR WORK</u></i></h3>
   <br>
   <p>He woke up. He got out of bed. He went to the restroom and took a shower.<br>
    The water was cold at first. He made it warm. He took ten minutes to shower.<br>
    He stepped out of the shower. The floor became wet. He grabbed a towel.<br>
    He wrapped it all around him. He went to his bathroom mirror.<br>
    He saw his reflection. He looked handsome. He had grown facial hair.<br>
    It was time for him to shave it. He grabbed the shaving cream and poured some in his hand.<br>
    He spread the shaving cream around his face. He grabbed the razor and started shaving.<br>
    He cut himself by accident. It started bleeding. He was not hurt.<br>
    He washed his face and applied aftershave. He put a band-aid on his cut.<br>
    The cut stung him a little. He dried himself and started getting ready for work.</p>
